# FileOrganizer

Project Title: File Organizer - Automated File Classification and Organization with Python

Project Description:

The File Organizer is a Python script designed to automate the process of classifying and organizing files within a specified directory. This project demonstrates the ability to create a practical and user-friendly solution for managing files effectively, making it easier to maintain a clutter-free and organized digital workspace.

Features:

Customizable folder structure: The script allows users to define their own folder structure based on file extensions or predefined categories (e.g., images, documents, videos, etc.).
Multiple file types supported: The script is capable of handling various file formats, including common document, image, video, and audio formats.
Recursive directory scanning: The File Organizer can process nested directories, ensuring that all files within the specified folder and its subfolders are organized.
Error handling and conflict resolution: The script includes error handling mechanisms to prevent file loss during the organization process, as well as the ability to handle duplicate file names.
User-friendly interface: The script is designed with ease of use in mind, featuring clear instructions and helpful prompts to guide users through the process.
How it works:

The user provides the source directory containing the files they want to organize.
The user specifies the target directory where the organized files will be saved.
The script scans the source directory, identifying files based on their extensions and categorizing them accordingly.
The script organizes the files into the appropriate folders in the target directory, maintaining the original folder structure when possible.
Project Outcome:

The File Organizer showcases the ability to develop a practical and efficient solution for automating file organization tasks. By categorizing files and maintaining a clean folder structure, the script offers a valuable tool for improving digital workspace organization and productivity. This project highlights the potential of Python for creating user-friendly, powerful, and time-saving solutions that simplify everyday tasks.
